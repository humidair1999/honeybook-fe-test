### to-dos & potential improvements

- Abstract API call into route on nodejs back-end, rather than call directly via client
- Use CSS preprocessor to reduce redundancy
- Use framework other than Bootstrap for greater customization and tailoring to specific project
- Abstract contact card into Angular directive for reusability across larger application
- Add tests of some sort
- Spend some time really fine-tweaking styles to match design 100%
- Implement search/filter via search bar in header
- Add build process via nodejs to compile, concatenate, and minify all assets
